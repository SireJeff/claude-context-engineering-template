## Option 1: The Problem-Solution Approach (Comprehensive)

𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗔𝗜 𝗶𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲. 🧠💸

And it's wasting 40-60% of its tokens on noise.

Here's the problem I noticed:
- AI asks generic questions because it lacks context
- It reads every file to find entry points
- It doesn't know your architecture, patterns, or conventions
- Token waste = higher bills + more carbon emissions

**I built an open-source solution.**

𝗻𝗽𝘅 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹-𝗮𝗶-𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁

**One command. Scans your codebase once. Generates perfect context for ALL your AI tools.**

### What it actually does:

✅ **Analyzes your project** — Detects languages, frameworks, entry points, workflows
✅ **Maps your architecture** — Creates a navigation guide for AI to follow
✅ **Generates tool-specific configs** — One scan, outputs for 7 different AI tools
✅ **Syncs everywhere** — Edit once, propagate to all tools automatically
✅ **Detects drift** — Warns when code outpaces documentation

### Supported Tools (7 ecosystems):

| Tool | What it generates |
|------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | AI_CONTEXT.md + specialized agents/commands |
| GitHub Copilot | .github/copilot-instructions.md |
| Cline | .clinerules |
| Antigravity | .agent/ (10 config files) |
| Windsurf | .windsurf/rules.md |
| Aider | .aider.conf.yml |
| Continue | .continue/config.json |

### The Result:

→ **40-60% less token usage** (AI knows where to look)
→ **Better code suggestions** (AI understands your patterns)
→ **Faster development** (No more "what does this project do?" loops)
→ **Lower carbon footprint** (Fewer wasted tokens = less energy)

### What gets created:

```
your-project/
├── AI_CONTEXT.md              ← Universal entry point
├── .ai-context/               ← Single source of truth
│   ├── context/
│   │   ├── ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT.md
│   │   ├── CODE_TO_WORKFLOW_MAP.md
│   │   ├── KNOWN_GOTCHAS.md
│   │   └── TESTING_MAP.md

│   └── commands/              ← 11 slash commands
├── .github/copilot-instructions.md
├── .clinerules
└── [configs for all 7 tools...]
```

**Try it in 30 seconds:**

`npx create-universal-ai-context`

Or for specific tools:
`npx create-universal-ai-context --ai claude,copilot,windsurf`

**I'm building toward a Universal AI Context Standard.**

This isn't just a tool—it's a pattern. If this became the default, we could cut industry-wide AI token waste by 50%.

**Looking for contributors:**
- Cursor users (have their API?)
- Codeium power users
- Tabnine developers
- Real-world testing across diverse codebases

## Option 2: The "Before & After" Visual (Quick Impact)

𝗕𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲: Your AI reads everything, asks generic questions, wastes tokens.

𝗔𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿: Your AI knows your project, asks smart questions, saves 40-60% tokens.

One command makes the difference:

𝗻𝗽𝘅 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲-𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹-𝗮𝗶-𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁

### What it does:

Scans your codebase → Generates intelligent context → Outputs configs for 7 AI tools

**Works with:** Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cline, Antigravity, Windsurf, Aider, Continue

### What you get:

→ Architecture map
→ Workflow documentation
→ Agent definitions (6 specialized agents)
→ Slash commands (11 commands)
→ Tech stack detection
→ Drift detection

### Why it matters:

Every token wasted is:
- 💸 Money down the drain
- 🌡️ Unnecessary carbon emissions
- ⏱️ Time waiting for AI responses

**40-60% of AI token usage is redundant context.** This tool fixes that.

`npx create-universal-ai-context`

**Try it. Break it. Make it better.**

## Option 3: The "Mission-Driven" Story (Emotional Hook)

Every token your AI wastes is carbon we can't get back. 🌱

AI will soon consume more energy than 22% of US households[^1]. Most of that? Wasted on reading irrelevant code.

I couldn't accept that.

So I built **Universal AI Context Engineering** — an open-source CLI that cuts AI token waste by 40-60%.

### How it works:

**One scan. Seven AI tools. Infinite savings.**

`npx create-universal-ai-context`

It analyzes your codebase once and generates:
- Architecture maps
- Workflow guides
- Tool-specific configurations
- Agent definitions
- Command libraries

### The Impact:

✅ **Lower bills** — Pay for useful tokens, not noise
✅ **Faster AI** — Less context = quicker responses
✅ **Better code** — AI understands your patterns
✅ **Real carbon reduction** — Fewer tokens = less energy

### Supported Tools:

Claude Code • GitHub Copilot • Cline • Antigravity • Windsurf • Aider • Continue

### The Vision:

I'm building toward the **Universal AI Context Standard**.

Imagine if this became the default:
- Every AI tool generates from the same context
- Token waste drops by 50% industry-wide
- **Real carbon reduction at scale**

### I need your help:

This is open source. This is all of us.

Looking for contributors for:
- **Cursor** integration
- **Codeium** support
- **Tabnine** adapters
- Real-world testing

**Try it:**
`npx create-universal-ai-context --ai windsurf,aider,continue`

**GitHub:** https://github.com/SireJeff/claude-context-engineering-template
**npm:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-universal-ai-context

Together, let's make AI context engineering the default—not the exception.
